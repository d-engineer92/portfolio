# Instagram session is managed via browser cookie import.
# Run: python setup_session.py --browser-cookie
# This avoids password-based login which triggers Instagram's
# "new device detected" security alerts.

# Residential proxy URL (optional)
# Route Instagram requests through a residential IP to avoid datacenter IP blocks.
# Example: PROXY_URL=http://100.100.100.100:8888
